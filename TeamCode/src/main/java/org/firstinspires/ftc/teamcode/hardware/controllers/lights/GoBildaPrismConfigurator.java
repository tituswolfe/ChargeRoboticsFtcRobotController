 *
 * This file is not meant to serve as example code - unless you're trying to create a telemetry-based
 * UI for the drivers station.
 * For example code that your team can leverage in your autonomous/teleop code to recall artboards
 * check out the GoBildaPrismArtboardExample. Run this code on your robot and use it to create
 * the artboards you'd like to be able to switch between. This means that switching between animations
 * can be very fast and easy, and the work of creating animations (and sending this information over
 * I²C) only has to happen once!
