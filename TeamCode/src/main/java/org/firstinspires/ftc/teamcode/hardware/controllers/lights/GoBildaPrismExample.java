/*
 * This example file shows how to create a couple of different Animations on the Prism, and save
 * them to an Artboard on the device.
 * The example file called "GoBildaPrismConfigurator" is designed to create a user-interface
 * through your driver's station. This is a great way to create Artboards from Animations, but
 * doesn't let you control quite everything about the available Animations. If you'd like to
 * do something more complex, or would just prefer to create your Artboard in Java, this
 * program shows you how.
 * The example file called "GoBildaPrismArtboardExample" shows how to recall different Artboards
 * that you have already saved to the device. That file shows the code you should consider adding
 * to your OpMode if you would like to dynamically change the Artboard shown by your LEDs during
 * the match.
 *
 * Core to understanding how to use this product is knowing these three terms:
 * Animations: (Like RAINBOW or BLINK) - These have properties you can configure, like their color.
 * They can have unique start and end points!
 * Layers: There are 10 layers, each of which can store an animation. These are hierarchical.
 * So an Animation on layer 5 will cover an animation on layer 2 if they overlap.
 * You can use start and end points to have layers overlap to create new patterns! Or show multiple
 * animations at once on different LEDs.
 * Artboards: An Artboard is a set of 10 layers which is stored on the Prism.
 * you can have up to 8 unique Artboards. Artboards are easy and computationally fast to switch between.
